# UITapGestureRecognizer Experiment

## Objective

I wanted to understand how `UITapGestureRecognizer` worked, and I built a simple iOS app that has a square in the middle. If you tap anywhere on that square, the label at the top of the screen will show the exact location (`CGPoint`) of where you tapped.


## Specs

* Swift 5
* Xcode 11.4
